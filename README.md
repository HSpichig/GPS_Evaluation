# GPS_Evaluation
Script for conducting a Bayesian evaluation of a single point location data recovered from a mobile device.

This python script provides the tools to conduct a Bayesian evaluation of a single point localisation as described in the article *A Likelihood Ratio Approach for the Evaluation of Single Point Device Locations*. This article is currently being reviewed and awaiting publication. A link and a reference to the article will be provided after publication. If you found this page before publication of the article you are either a reviewer (I look forwards to your comments; thank you for checking my links) or are looking for a solution to the problem of GPS evaluation (which the article should provide you with). If you cannot wait half a year due to legal restraints, feel free to contact me.

The first version of this repository is the code provided as an Annex in the aforementionned article. It is update as new results become available and I have time to make the code more accessible. This is not my dayjob. If you are missing a feature and feel that updating intervals are too long, feel fre to develop it yourself.
